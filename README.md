# ML-bluebook-for-bulldozers
Machine learning model to predict the sale price of bull dozers.

Model developed using Python Machine Learning and Data Science framework and libraries, including jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn.

Full documentation included in the jupyter notebooks:

1. <a href="https://github.com/JHarrisJoshua/ML-bluebook-for-bulldozers/blob/main/Bulldozer-Price-Regression.ipynb">Bulldozer-Price-Regression.ipynb<a>

    - Time series regression model developed using sklearn's ensemble Random Forest Regressor as the estimator. 
    - Working version contains limited data scrubbing and experimentation. Included for documentation/completeness. 

2. Final version in progress

    - Model includes enhanced exploratory data analysis(EDA) and additional hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.
